The source code for ``LaTeX for Complete Novices''.

I've only used it under Linux, I can't guarantee if it will work
under other platforms.

Files with the extension .jdr were created using JpgfDraw. The
files book.jdr, screen.jdr and a4paper.jdr were used to create the files
novices-book.sty, novices-screen.sty and novices-a4paper.sty which set up the
text areas for the paperback, screen PDF and A4 PDF versions.

The HTML version requires datetime.perl, fmtcount.perl,
glossaries.perl and mfirstuc.perl. These are distributed with the
datetime package, fmtcount package and glossaries package. (At least
glossaries version 3.03 required.)
