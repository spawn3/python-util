A \gls*{short} is a \gls{command} whose \gls{argument} may not
contain a paragraph break (either as a blank line or using
\glsi{par}.) Conversely, a \keywordfmt{long command} is a command whose
\gls{argument} may contain a paragraph break.

Using short commands helps to test for forgotten braces, so it is
recommended that when you \htmlref{define a new
command}{ch:newcom}\latex{ (see \chapterref{ch:newcom})} you should
always make the command a short command, unless there is a chance
that the argument may need to contain a paragraph break.
